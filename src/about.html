    <h1 id="about-the-artist">About the artist</h1>

    <p>I'm Triage, but you also can call me Kian or Eddie, I'm not picky. I'm an artist of many mediums living on stolen Omàmìwininìwag-Anishinabewaki land. I'm a creature of many forms, and may appear as a common vampire bat, Honduran white bat, serval, Scottish Fold cat, or zebra-unicorn. </p>

    <p><b>Convention history:</b> Ottawa Comiccon '14, Ottawa Winter Comiccon '24, CanFURence '23 + '24 + '25, Furnal Equinox '25</p>

    <h3 id="-i-make-things">🎨 I make things</h3>

    <p>I've been teaching myself how to illustrate since I was able to pick up a pencil, and how to build costumes since around 2009. My main focus is on digital paintings of anthropomorphic animal characters, and I love working with eye-catching colour palettes and rendering my pieces in a painterly style. I also dabble in a few other creative endeavours, such as toy customization, crochet, 3D modeling, and other crafts.</p>

    <p>Fursuit making is another big passion of mine, and something I hope to turn into a business venture in the future. I'm in the midst of making my own work space for creating fursuits, and hope to invest in equipment that will allow me to build high-quality wearable art.</p>

    <p>Coding is another endeavour of mine that I've become very passionate about in the past few years. I'm still a huge novice at it, but I'm constantly learning new things about it, and honestly wouldn't have expected myself to be where I currently am with it even just 2 years ago! Right now my focus is on HTML/CSS (which I know isn't a "real" programming language, trust me), but I have plans to dip my toes into coding my own Javascript and Python scripts in the future! </p>

    <h3 id="-i-m-queer">🌈 I'm queer</h3>

    <p>My queer identity is something that's rather important to me! I label my sexuality rather vaguely on purpose, but I'm cool with being called gay or queer. I also identify as being an androgyne male, which is a shorthand for saying "I am a binary male who expresses himself as being both feminine and masculine."</p>

    <p>In terms of my relationships, I'm ambiamorous, which means I'm okay with being in either a monogamous or polyamorous relationship! I've been in a very loving relationship with my partner since October 24th, 2019! </p>

    <h3 id="-i-m-disabled">♿ I'm disabled</h3>

    <p>I'm multiply disabled, including developmental (<span class="hovertxt" data-title="Medium support needs">MSN Autism</span>, <span class="hovertxt" data-title="APD, Dyscaluculia">learning disabled</span>, dyspraxia), physical (<a href="https://ehlers-danlos.org.nz/heds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hEDS</a>, <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/autoimmunity-neuroinflammation-in-fibromyalgia-5197944" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FMS</a>, <a href="https://me-pedia.org/wiki/Myalgic_encephalomyelitis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ME/CFS</a>, etc.) and <span class="hovertxt" data-title="Not your business">psychological disabilities</span>. Naturally, these conditions significantly impact every part of my waking life, including my abilities to work and socialize, so I appreciate being given grace and patience in these situations.</p>
    
    <p>Being disabled is a large part of my identity, and I'm very into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cripple_punk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cripplepunk movement</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_pride" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mad Pride</a> as a result. I also hope to become more involved in disability rights activism in the future, as well as educating the general public and newly-disabled people.</p>

    <p>I use a variety of aids in my daily life to help me function a little better, including (but not limited to) a rollator walker, a mobility scooter, and high- and low-tech <a href="https://www.assistiveware.com/learn-aac/what-is-aac" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AAC</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="-i-m-a-furry">🐾 I'm a furry</h3>

    <p>I've been calling myself a furry since around 2008, but I've seen myself in anthropomorphic animals for as long as I can remember. Thanks to the Warrior Cats community on YouTube, I discovered what a 'fursona' was, and by extension learned about the existence of furry fandom. It's safe to say that the trajectory of my life changed since then, with me having carved a place for myself in the community and made many friends within the fandom that I call home.</p>

    <p>My current main fursona is <a href="https://toyhou.se/5419850.hyson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyson</a> the vampire bat! I created him back in late 2019, and he's evolved with me ever since. He's a vampiric fairy who lives with his life partner, Mez the highland cow, in a modest apartment somewhere in eastern Ontario and keeps himself busy with his various hobbies and passions. </p>

    <p>My secondary fursona is <a href="https://toyhou.se/27456927.kardia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kardia</a> the serval! Created sometime in mid 2024, Kardia is an angel-demon surgeon working in his own hospital, who partakes in many morally questionable surgeries.</p>

    <p>I do have a few other fursonas as well, but mentioning all of them here would take forever. Feel free to check <a href="https://toyhou.se/tri4ge/characters/folder:251907" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my Toyhouse folder</a> to see all of the other characters I represent myself as!</p>

    <h3 id="-i-m-a-leftist">🍉 I'm a leftist</h3>

    <p>I have only just recently started to scratch the surface in understanding leftist ideology, but I've found myself believing in a lot of leftist schools of thought. Currently, my beliefs align the most with Marxist Communism—I still have lots of studying to do on the subject, but I try my best to make sure that my actions are not only rooted in compassion and care for my fellow comrades, but also grounded with theory.</p>
    <p>A few of the things I believe in include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Prison/police abolition and rehabilitative justice.</li>
        <li>Black Lives Matter and Black liberation.</li>
        <li>Land Back and decolonisation.</li>
        <li>Freedom and liberation for Palestine, Sudan, the DRC, Artsahk, Yemen, Kashmir, and all other oppressed groups undergoing persecution and genocide.</li>
        <li>LGBT rights, including the protection of trans youth.</li>
        <li>Harm reduction and total drug decriminalisation.</li>
        <li>Anti-psychiatry (as an institution, read more about this <a href="https://pasleciel.substack.com/p/an-antipsychiatry-faq?r=3pl4w9&triedRedirect=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>).</li>
        <li>Anti-fascism, anti-white supremacy, and anti-Nazism.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="-my-interests">🧩 My interests</h3>
    <p>Outside of art, I'm very enthusiastic about plushies & toy collecting, amusements & theme parks, photography, horror media, cooking & baking, coding & web development, technology & computer science, trains & planes, and much more. Future ventures I'm interested in partaking in include video editing, programming/coding, and disability activism.</p>

    <p>I don't know how to many any myself, but I'm also a huge lover of listening to music! Some of my favourite genres include electronic, space and alternative rock, alternative metal, industrial, gabber, DnB and jungle, hip hop and rap, break and raggacore, IDM, and anything that's experimental and eclectic. </p>

    <h3 id="-why-triage-">🏥 Why <em>Triage</em>?</h3>
    <p>I came up with the name Triage due to wanting to associate my art alias and branding with medical sciences and imagery. As someone who is both disabled and a medical trauma survivor, I like to think of this as being my attempt at reclaiming medical themes as a source of empowerment and comfort. Admittedly, it's a bit hard to explain how I find comfort in things like medical science and hospitals to people who haven't experienced this kind of trauma, but I find those who have just get it immediately.</p>

    <p><em>(Also, for the record, Tri4ge is still pronounced as "Triage," not "Try-fourge,")</em></p>
