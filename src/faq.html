<h3 id="how-did-you-teach-yourself-how-to-draw-">How did you teach yourself how to draw?</h3>
<p>A lot of patience. Yes, practice is a huge part of the learning process and everyone will tell you that, but so is having patience with yourself and the progression of your skills. As much I would've loved for it to happen, I didn't wake up one day with the skillset I have today, and I had to wait through years of being a total amateur before I got somewhere. Be patient with yourself, we all learn things at a different pace. That being said, I also have a few other pieces of advice for those who are just starting out with art:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Learn about composition in visual arts, especially the 7 elements of art. In fact, I consider this pre-requisite material because everything you create will involve these elements.  </li>
    <li>Reference everything, and don't believe a single soul who tells you that you're cheating by referencing. Everyone uses references, everyone <em>has</em> to use references at some point in their life, it's no different when you're an artist. Reference from real life, reference from 2D artwork, reference from 3D models, reference from costumes and fursuits, reference from everything you need to. Just would advise against referencing off of genAI works—not only are there ethical concerns with genAI, but it's also not going to give you an accurate idea of things like anatomy and elements.</li>
    <li>Studying doesn't have to be boring either- try and relate it to your interests somehow! Wanting to study fabric? Do 30 minutes of study, then draw your favourite or original character in long flowing clothes! Doing value studies? Draw your favourite animal! Studying might still be a little bit boring, but while you genuinely just have to draw things that don't fit your interests, you also don't have to eat your vegetables without seasoning.  </li>
    <li>Waiting until you magically develop the skillset you need to draw certain things is just shooting yourself in the foot. Take risks and be sloppy about it, because it's the only way you're going to be able to get your feet in the water with learning different skills.  </li>
    <li>That being said, tutorials are your friend and I highly recommend seeking them out for yourself. Find tutorials for whatever you're interested in—such as perspective, anatomy, lighting, and composition—and study.  </li>
    <li>Your unique style will come with time, practice, and studying. Don't get down on yourself for not having a distinct style when you're still a beginner.  </li>
    <li>And finally, remember that the artists you look up to have all started at the same place as you, and needed to do the work to build their skills to where you want them to be.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-did-you-learn-to-build-fursuits-">How did you learn to build fursuits?</h3>
<p>A lot of the same things I said in the question above could be said the same about fursuit building, but I especially recommend saving up and putting in the money to buy yourself good quality tools and materials, especially when it comes to your fabric. Fursuit building on a budget is still possible, but there are some things that will fall apart and render your project unrecoverable if it isn't up-to-par in quality (not to mention, the possibility of injuring yourself by wearing a fursuit head made of cheap and dangerous materials). </p>
<p>It's entirely possible to sew a fursuit without a sewing machine, and you'll also want to learn four hand stitches in particular: blanket, back, ladder, and muppet. However, when it comes to making bodysuits, I highly recommend investing in a sewing machine, as this will not only save your hands from a lot of agony, but will also make your stitches much stronger. </p>
<p>Our community even has a ton of tutorials made for newbies to read and watch on practically every part of fursuit building, don't be afraid to use them! I have a bunch listed on my <a href="/links" rel="noopener noreferrer">/links</a> page for you to check out!</p>

<h3 id="how-did-you-learn-to-code-how-did-you-code-x-">How did you learn to code/how did you code [X]?</h3>
<p>It started out with me editing my profile on sites like DeviantArt, Tumblr, and Toyhouse, until I moved onto using templates for my first few static sites hosted on Neocities. From there, anytime I wanted to do something specific with my coding, I'd look it up on my search engine of choice and learn from there. </p>
<p>There's easily way better methods of learning how to code though, and I honestly don't recommend using templates over making your own layouts from scratch, as they can be very limiting in what you're able to do. To make this easier for anyone learning how to code, I have many links on my <a href="/links" rel="noopener noreferrer">/links</a> page that can help steer you in the right direction!</p>

<h3 id="can-i-use-your-artwork-as-my-profile-picture-banner-on-social-media-">Can I use your artwork as my profile picture/banner on social media?</h3>
<p>If it's something you've gotten commissioned from me, then it's part of my <a href="/tos" rel="noopener noreferrer">terms of service</a> that you're allowed to use it on your social media profiles with credit! Similarly, I also allow fanart to be used in the same way.</p>
<p>If it's art with my own personal characters, I'd prefer if you didn't, but I can't physically stop you from doing so. If it's art that is made for other people with their own characters, then I highly discourage you from using said artwork.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-reupload-your-artwork-on-another-website-">Can I reupload your artwork on another website?</h3>
<p>Please ask beforehand, or at the very least, credit me when you do so. However, you're more than free to share links to my artwork to other sites, since this directly connects people to it! </p>

<h3 id="can-i-take-inspiration-from-your-artwork-fursuit-work-website-">Can I take inspiration from your artwork/fursuit work/website?</h3>
<p>Absolutely, please do! In fact, I don't even care that much about my stuff being referenced, copied or traced, so long as I'm credited in some way. I'm an advocate for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">copyleft</a> and don't believe in intellectual property.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-request-art-from-you-">Can I request art from you?</h3>
<p>You can submit a form to commission personalized artwork from me, but I don't do free artwork for anybody! I do sometimes do art trades, but this is exclusive to friends, acquaintances, and mutuals.</p>

<h3 id="can-you-code-a-site-for-me-">Can you code a site for me?</h3>
<p>Probably not, definitely not for free. Coding is one of those things that I don't always have interest in doing and is an interest that comes in phases. I do make a few exceptions for friends, but those are made on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-your-fursona-a-vampire-bat-">Why is your fursona a vampire bat?</h3>
<p>Depends on if you wanna hear the simple or real answer!</p>
<p><strong>Simple answer:</strong> It's a metaphor for being disabled and dependent on others for your own survival. I "feed" off of the lives of others in order to sustain my own, the same way vampire bats feed off of the blood of other animals.</p>
<p><strong>Real answer:</strong> My partner actually came up with the idea of us being a common vampire bat and cow couple, since common vampire bats feed off of cattle! We both thought this dynamic was cute and interesting to explore in both of our fursonas' lore, where Mez (my partner's fursona) provides Hyson with his blood meals. The disability metaphor still stands here, and especially so if you consider Mez to be a kind of caregiver for Hyson. The vampire bat was also generally everything I was looking for in a fursona species—a small, flying mammal with an ugly-cute pug-like face!</p>
<p>I also just relate heavily to vampire bats in general! After my partner suggested it as a fursona species, I started researching more into them, and found out that I'm so much like one! Not only do I heavily relate to vampirism as a disabled person, but I also relate to the way vampire bats are creatures who practice interdependence, which is something I value more than complete independence. I see myself in them so much that I truly believe my soul and physicality is that of a vampire bat, rather than being human. </p>

<p>I also have other fursonas of other species, but I won't get into every single one of them and why I chose their species here, otherwise this would end up becoming an entire essay to cover all of them.</p>

<h3 id="you-have-medium-support-needs-what-does-that-mean-">You have medium support needs? What does that mean?</h3> 
<p>In layman's terms, support needs are based how much support a disabled person requires in order to meet their needs. Support needs range from being high to low, and those with medium support needs tend to require a moderate amount of support overall. This can appear in a number of ways, and many people with medium support needs tend to have what is called a "spiky profile," meaning that they may have low support needs in some areas, and vice versa in others. </p>
<p>For me, personally, I wouldn't be considered high support needs, as I'm able to use verbose language, don't have Intellectual Disability, and don't need constant supervision. However, there's still many areas where I need substantial support in, which makes it so that I can't live independently, drive, or work a full-time job, and require a caretaker to help me with my activities of daily living (which include many self-care tasks.) </p>
<p>While it's not a perfect system, many people confuse support needs with functioning labels, when they really shouldn't be conflated with one another. Whereas functioning labels focus on what the person can do to contribute and function, support needs focus on what individuals need in order to support themselves. Functioning labels were also flawed for the fact that these levels could change on a daily basis, whereas support needs are relatively stable and are persistent even on our better days. <strong>Even when I'm having a good day, I still require a substantial level of support that is static.</strong></p>

<h3 id="are-you-really-disabled-do-you-really-have-xyz-">Are you <em>really</em> disabled / do you <em>really</em> have [XYZ]?</h3>
<p>Yes, I am professionally diagnosed. If you don't believe me, that's your problem to solve, so leave me out of it.</p>
